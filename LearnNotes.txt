What did I learn from idtech 4.5?

Separating game logic from engine logic makes for a 'cleaner' design.

You can separate out logical units of game behavior like a camera or a static object with a transform and
from the game logic layer, you have a separation of 'how an object does a thing' vs 'what you want an object to do'

For example.
Let's say I have a static entity. It has a transform, it has geometry. It has at least one material per geometric object.
From a game standpoint. We don't have knowledge of how a transform gets into the rendering engine. We don't have
knowledge of how the material gets passed into a HDR framebuffer. We just know that these things exist.
We also don't care about the lifetime of the object (when it is loaded and when it is freed).
