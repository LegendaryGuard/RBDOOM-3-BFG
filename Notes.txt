1. Generating bimage file paths are too long. Make then shorter somehow.The generated images for combineRgba doesn't work at all.
2. Envprobe only applies to the current area num the player is in. Envprobes should only apply to the current area the probe is in.
I don't think this is a screen space technique, so I should be able to get the surfaces the probes affect just like with lights.


Improving the tools
1. Make it so that the mouse clicks work and that imgui stuff eats up the mouse clicks that intersect the imgui windows.
2. Add back debug text that render within the world. I want to see information for entities within the actual world instead of being displayed through the console.

Adding In-World Text Rendering for Debug and Gameplay


# How is the world rendered?
The RenderWorld contains the "scene graph"
- AddEntityRef adds an entity to the world. This creates all the rendering stuff to draw it. Vertices and stuff.
- Dynamic vertices are generated on the front end every frame unless it is optionally cached.

# Add Debug Text

## Purpose
Add back debug text that render within the world. I want to see information for entities within the actual world instead of being displayed through the console.

## Design
Add a Model_text to allocate vertices and set the material. This is already done in TextBufferManager.

Add a new debug_add_text method in the front-end that loops through the surfaces and then add our new geometry above an entity.

GuiModel::EmitToCurrentView can probably be used.

Can possibly use idRenderBackend::DBG_RenderDrawSurfListWithFunction to add these debug text vertices to the draw calls.
Seems a little hacky, but whatever?
